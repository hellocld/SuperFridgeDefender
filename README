Super Fridge defender is a game about love, loss, and deflecting flying kittens with a paddle. The goal is to let the food and drink fly into the fridge while preventing the nonfood and nondrink from entering. Use the arrow keys to move the paddle up and down, x to start and q to quit.

Super Fridge Defender was coded in two hours for the 58th Klik of the Month Klub game jam hosted by Glorious Trainwrecks. Special thanks go to Photonstorm for the excellent tutorial on bullet managers (it's how I managed to make an "infinite" amount of food/junk). All code and graphics are free for any and all to do whatever they like with. Just be awesome and give me a little spot in the credits or something, or show me what you made with it.
